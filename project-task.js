/*
Objective:
This activity helps students practice creating classes, defining constructors, adding methods,
and instantiating objects using those classes. Students will design a Vehicle class and use it
to create a fleet of different vehicle objects.



Scenario
You’ve been hired to help a logistics company build a system to manage its fleet of vehicles.
The system should be able to:
  Create individual vehicles with properties like type, make, model, year, and mileage.
  Add a method to update the mileage of a vehicle when it is used.
  Add a method to display the details of the vehicle in a user-friendly format.
  Instantiate multiple vehicles from the class and test the methods.



Instructions
Define the Vehicle Class:
  The constructor should include properties: type, make, model, year, and mileage.
  Use default values for mileage (e.g., 0).

Add Methods:
  drive(distance): Increases the vehicle’s mileage by the given distance (in kilometers or miles).
  getDetails(): Returns a formatted string describing the vehicle’s details.

Create and Use Vehicle Objects:
  Instantiate at least three vehicle objects with different properties (e.g., a car, a truck, and a motorcycle).
  Use the drive method to simulate trips and update mileage.
  Use the getDetails method to print each vehicle’s updated information.

// Starter Code
// Begin with these prompts:

// Step 1: Create the Vehicle class

// Step 2: Add the drive(distance) method

// Step 3: Add the getDetails() method

// Step 4: Instantiate at least three vehicles and test the methods
