🚗 Vehicle Class Activity
===========================================

🎯 Objective:
This activity helps students practice:

- Creating classes
- Defining constructors
- Adding methods
- Instantiating objects

Students will design a `Vehicle` class and use it
to create a fleet of different vehicle objects.

---

🛠️ Scenario:
You’ve been hired to help a logistics company build a system 
to manage its fleet of vehicles.

The system should be able to:

✅ Create individual vehicles with properties like:
   - type
   - make
   - model
   - year
   - mileage

✅ Add a method to update the mileage when a vehicle is used

✅ Add a method to display details in a user-friendly format

✅ Instantiate multiple vehicles and test their functionality

---

📋 Instructions:

1️⃣ Define the Vehicle Class:
   - Constructor should include: `type`, `make`, `model`, `year`, `mileage`
   - Set a default value for `mileage` (e.g., 0)

2️⃣ Add Methods:
   - `drive(distance)`: Increases mileage by the given distance
   - `getDetails()`: Returns a formatted string with the vehicle's details

3️⃣ Create and Use Vehicle Objects:
   - Instantiate at least three vehicles (e.g., car, truck, motorcycle)
   - Use `drive()` to simulate trips
   - Use `getDetails()` to print updated info
